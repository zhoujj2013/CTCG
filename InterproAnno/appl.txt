Applications	STRING
A number of different protein sequence applications are launched. These applications search against specific databases and have preconfigured cut off thresholds.
ProDom	default
	BlastProDom
	description	Scans the families in the ProDom database. ProDom is a comprehensive set of protein domain families automatically generated from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL sequence databases using psi-blast. In InterProScan the blastpgb program is used to scan the database. BLASTPGP performs gapped blastp searches and can be used to perform iterative searches in PSI-BLAST and PHI-BLAST mode.
PRINTS	default
	FPrintScan
	description	Scans against the fingerprints in the PRINTS database. These fingerprints are groups of motifs that together are more potent than single motifs by making use of the biological context inherent in a multiple motif method.
PIRSF	default
	HMMPIR
	description	Scans the hidden markov models (HMMs) that are present in the PIR Protein Sequence Database (PSD) of functionally annotated protein sequences, PIR-PSD.
PfamA	default
	HMMPfam
	description	Scans the hidden markov models (HMMs) that are present in the PFAM Protein families database.
SMART	default
	HMMSmart
	description	Scans the hidden markov models (HMMs) that are present in the SMART domain/domain families database.
TIGRFAM	default
	HMMTigr
	description	Scans the hidden markov models (HMMs) that are present in the TIGRFAMs protein families database.
PrositeProfiles	default
	ProfileScan
	description	Scans against PROSITE profiles. These profiles are based on weight matrices and are more sensitive for the detection of divergent protein families.
HAMAP	default
	HAMAP
	description	Scans against HAMAP profiles. These profiles are based on weight matrices and are more sensitive for the detection of divergent bacterial, archaeal and plastid-encoded protein families.
PrositePatterns	default
	PatternScan
	description	PatternScan is a new version of the PROSITE pattern search software which uses new code developed by the PROSITE team.
SuperFamily	default
	SuperFamily
	description	SUPERFAMILY is a library of profile hidden Markov models that represent all proteins of known structure.
SignalP	default
	SignalPHMM
TMHMM	default
	TMHMM
Panther	default
	HMMPanther
Gene3d	default
	Gene3D
Phobius	default
	Phobius
Coils	default
	Coils
